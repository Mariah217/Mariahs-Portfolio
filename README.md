# Portfolio

## Description

My motivation was to get better practice using more advanced CSS elements. I built this webiste to use as my portfolio when I am job hunting and to display all the projects I have been working on. Being able to build this website has taught me a lot about flex and justify-content and also how to create boxes throughout my web page.

## Usage





Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
