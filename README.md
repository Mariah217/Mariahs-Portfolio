# Portfolio

## Description

My motivation was to get better practice using more advanced CSS elements. I built this webiste to use as my portfolio when I am job hunting and to display all the projects I have been working on. Being able to build this website has taught me a lot about flex and justify-content and also how to create boxes throughout my web page.
